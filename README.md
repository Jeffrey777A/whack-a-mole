# whack-a-mole
Vanilla JavaScript game

The idea of whack-a-mole is simple! The player needs to hit the grid with the mole in as many times as possible until the time runs out. In this tutorial, we will cover:

<ul>
  <li>document.querySelector</li>
   <li>textContent</li>
   <li>forEach</li>
   <li>addEventListener</li>
   <li>
setInterval</li>
   <li>classList.add</li>
</ul>
